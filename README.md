## What's the buzz about the Jenius App

I really dislike the Jenius app and have had several bad experiences using it. It runs very slowly, feels heavy, and stops unexpectedly. 
I have no idea what's going on. I wonder if it's because of my 6-year-old phone or if other people are experiencing the same thing.
